manufac
=======

manufac is a command line interface to Manual Labour, which allows to create
beautiful and practical step-by-step instructions from the command line.  It
is based on an expressive plain text format that is read- and writeable by
humans and can export the finished instructions into a number of formats.

The (pseudo)latin word `manufac` roughly means "Create!" or "Make!".
